**Questions to Investigate**: 
- What are the key differences in features, performance, and stability between the two forks based on recent community discussions (late 2025)?
- Where are users discussing these plugins (e.g., GitHub issues/discussions, Reddit, forums)?
- What are the primary reasons users choose one fork over the other?
- Are there any migration guides or common pitfalls when switching between the two?
