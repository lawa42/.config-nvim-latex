# Direct Comparison and Recent Discussion

## Questions to Investigate:
- What are the main differences between NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim and sudo-tee/opencode.nvim?
- How do their features, philosophies, and community engagement compare?
- What are the recent discussions (closer to Dec 2025) saying about switching between these two or recommending one over the other?
- Are there any specific use cases where one is clearly preferred over the other?
