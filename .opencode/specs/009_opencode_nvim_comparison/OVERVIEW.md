# Research Topic: Comparison of opencode.nvim forks

## Original Request:
I am currently using https://github.com/NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim but I'm considering switching to https://github.com/sudo-tee/opencode.nvim and want to know what people are saying about the two and how they compare. Privelege recent information and discussion (closer to Dec 2025 the better).

## Research Summary for `sudo-tee/opencode.nvim`:

**Key Features:** `sudo-tee/opencode.nvim` is a Neovim frontend for the `opencode` AI agent, offering a context-aware chat interface, persistent sessions, and integration with editor features like diffing and snapshots. It provides two built-in agents (Build and Plan) and supports custom agents. It's a fork of `goose.nvim`.

**Community Sentiment:** Community sentiment, primarily from recent Reddit discussions, is highly positive. Users praise its "flawless" and "native" integration into Neovim workflows, its ability to provide editor-aware prompts, and its continuous development with UX improvements.

**Strengths:** Deep native Neovim integration, strong contextual awareness, seamless workflow integration, flexibility (e.g., external CLI support), and experimental but powerful version control features (snapshots, diffs).

**Weaknesses:** The project is in early development, which implies potential bugs and breaking changes. It also has a dependency on the `opencode` CLI.

**Common Issues/Praise Points:** Recent discussions highlight the excellent native integration, context-awareness, and UX improvements as key praise points. No significant common issues were identified beyond the general caution for early-stage software.
