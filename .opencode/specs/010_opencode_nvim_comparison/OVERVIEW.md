I am currently using https://github.com/NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim but I'm considering switching to https://github.com/sudo-tee/opencode.nvim and want to know what people are saying about the two and how they compare. Privilege recent information and discussion (closer to Dec 2025 the better).

### NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim - User Sentiment and Discussion
NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim is a well-received Neovim plugin with 1.1k stars on GitHub, integrating the opencode AI assistant for streamlined editor-aware research, reviews, and requests. User sentiment is generally positive, with discussions primarily focused on usage, configuration, and feature enhancements rather than critical bugs. Key areas of interest include integration with containerized environments, native Neovim diffs, and enhanced file selection.
