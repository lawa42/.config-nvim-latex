 # Research Topic: opencode.nvim Comparison

 ## Original Request:
 I am currently using https://github.com/NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim but I'm considering switching to https://github.com/sudo-tee/opencode.nvim and want to know what people are saying about the two and how they compare. Privilege recent information and discussion (closer to Dec 2025 the better).

### NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim User Sentiment and Discussion
NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim is a well-received Neovim plugin with 1.1k stars, integrating the opencode AI assistant for streamlined editor-aware tasks. User sentiment appears largely positive, driven by its robust feature set, flexible configuration, and ability to inject editor context into AI prompts. Common discussions revolve around integration with other Neovim tools and configuration queries, rather than critical issues.

### sudo-tee/opencode.nvim User Sentiment and Discussion
Due to the unavailability of the `websearch` tool, I was unable to perform the necessary web research to gather user sentiments, praises, criticisms, or discussions regarding `sudo-tee/opencode.nvim`. The research task requires the use of `websearch` to identify relevant sources before `webfetch` can be used to retrieve content.

### Comparison of NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim and sudo-tee/opencode.nvim
This report compares two Neovim plugins, `NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim` and `sudo-tee/opencode.nvim`, both designed to integrate the `opencode` AI assistant. While both provide editor-aware AI capabilities, `sudo-tee/opencode.nvim` offers a more integrated Neovim-native chat interface with robust session, snapshot, and restore point management, whereas `NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim` focuses on direct integration with the `opencode` CLI, leveraging its TUI and offering flexible provider options.
