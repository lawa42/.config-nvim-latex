# Research Topic: opencode.nvim Comparison

## Original Request:
I am currently using https://github.com/NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim but I'm considering switching to https://github.com/sudo-tee/opencode.nvim and want to know what people are saying about the two and how they compare. Privilege recent information and discussion (closer to Dec 2025 the better).
