# Research Topic: Opencode Neovim Plugin Comparison

## Executive Summary
This research compares `NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim` and `sudo-tee/opencode.nvim`, both Neovim plugins for integrating the opencode AI assistant. `NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim` is well-regarded, stable, and actively developed, primarily serving as a wrapper for the opencode CLI. In contrast, `sudo-tee/opencode.nvim` aims for a more native Neovim experience with an integrated chat and advanced session management, though it is in an earlier development stage with acknowledged stability concerns. While `NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim` boasts a larger community, `sudo-tee/opencode.nvim` focuses on deeper Neovim integration. A direct comparison suggests that `NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim` offers a more mature and stable experience, while `sudo-tee/opencode.nvim` presents a more ambitious, albeit less stable, native Neovim integration.

### Comparison and Key Differences
This report compares two Neovim plugins for integrating the `opencode` AI assistant: `NickvanDyke/opencode` and `sudo-tee/opencode.nvim`. The primary distinction lies in their approach: NickvanDyke's version acts more as a wrapper around the `opencode` CLI's TUI, while sudo-tee's offers a more native and feature-rich Neovim frontend with an integrated chat interface, advanced session management, and workspace snapshots. While NickvanDyke's plugin has a larger community and appears more stable, sudo-tee's is under active development with a focus on deeper Neovim integration, albeit with acknowledged early-stage stability concerns.
