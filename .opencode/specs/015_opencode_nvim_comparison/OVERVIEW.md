# Research Topic: Opencode.nvim Comparison

## Executive Summary
This research compared `NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim` and `sudo-tee/opencode.nvim`, both Neovim plugins for the `opencode` AI assistant. `NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim` is a more mature project, acting as a wrapper around the `opencode` TUI, offering seamless integration and flexible configuration with positive user sentiment. In contrast, `sudo-tee/opencode.nvim` is in earlier development but aims for a native Neovim chat interface with advanced features like contextual snapshots and restore points, also receiving positive feedback for its deep integration. While NickvanDyke's project boasts higher activity, sudo-tee's offers more innovative features for users seeking a fully native and customizable AI experience within Neovim. The choice between them depends on the user's preference for a stable, TUI-integrated experience versus a cutting-edge, native Neovim chat interface with advanced contextual capabilities.
