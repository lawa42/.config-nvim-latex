# Research Topic: OpenCode Neovim Plugin Comparison

## Executive Summary
The research compared two Neovim plugins for OpenCode AI integration: NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim and sudo-tee/opencode.nvim. NickvanDyke's plugin is more mature and community-supported, offering robust interaction with the OpenCode CLI and extensive context injection, with generally positive user sentiment from older discussions. In contrast, sudo-tee's plugin, while in early development, provides a more native Neovim chat interface with advanced features like workspace snapshots and persistent sessions, also receiving positive feedback despite some reported performance and UI challenges. Users considering a switch should weigh NickvanDyke's stability and established community against sudo-tee's innovative native features and active development, especially if prioritizing recent advancements.
